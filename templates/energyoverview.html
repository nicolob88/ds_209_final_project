					<div class="mission1">As energy demands become bigger every year, it is imperative to understand how much energy is being generated, how much is consumed and what is its cost. At the same time, the footprint that non-renewable energies are leaving on the planet is becoming more palpable every year, it has become of utmost importance to understand which are the sources we use to generate energy and how we can shift towards a more sustainable path. Using data from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php#StatisticsIndicators">EIA</a>, the dashboard below shows a summary of the energy generation for the US, by state and year, for the past two decades. The areas give a sense of the contribution each source had to the total generated energy, you can choose from the Metric filter to see those as percent share (normalized). The bubbles then give you additional details of the share each energy source had over the total energy generated. Last, the bars display how much each generated in total. The graph is interactive, you can select, by clicking, a year on the area chart, a state on the bar chart and/or source on the bubble chart to filter the graphs and access the details you want to see. To unselect, you can click on an empty space of the chart.</div>

					<div class="mission1">US energy generation has been growing steadily, except for a small dip during the pandemic of COVID-19, for the past 2 decades. The generation is measured in billions of British thermal units (bBTU) which grew roughly by 67% between 2001 and 2021. At the same time, major structural changes happened on the sources that account for the total energy generated. Coal dropped from being the main energy source in 2001 with 37% of the total to the third place with only 12% in 2021. On the other hand, Natural Gas has added over 25M bBTUs of energy generated during the same period, becoming the main source of energy with over 44% of the total energy in 2021. Renewable sources of energy have also increased slowly and steadily, adding 5 percent points of the total energy share, from 8% to 13% during the 2001-2021 period.<br>
					<br>
					From all the States, TX has been consistently the one that generated the most energy throughout the last 2 decades and is increasing the gap with other states. Nonetheless, 90% of the energy TX generated in 2021 came from Oil and Gas, and only 5% came from renewable sources. In that same year, the States that generated the most renewable energy were WA and CA.

					<div class="sectiontitle">Energy Consumption and Energy Generation</div>
					<div class="mission1">Besides understanding overall energy generation and consumption trends, it is also useful to understand the distribution from each energy source type: oil, gas, nuclear and renewable. When reviewing the details, user can find each energy source type trends over the years and discover energy source dependency shifts. The following visualization provides two decades of multiple generation and consumption views. From the top left corner,  the “Net US BBTU by year” chart provides the net energy view in terms of BBTU (Billion BTU, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit">British thermal unit</a>) that represents the measurement of heat as the form of energy. The calculation is based on comparing the differences between energy generation and consumption.  According to this chart, it shows that most of the year US states energy is in deficit. The pink bar  means consumption is higher than generation. The situation did not change until 2019, we finally saw a slight  energy surplus represented by the blue bar.
					<br><br>
					The lower left chart is named “US energy generation/consumption”.  This area chart provides the  generation and consumption detail in each year. Again, users may find the energy consumption is hovering around 90 to 100 trillion BTu. Energy generation on the other hand has been steadily rising from 70 to around 95 to 100 trillion BTu since 2001. 
					<br><br>
					The right small charts provide the details of generation and consumption for each energy source: Coal, Oil, Gas, Nuclear and renewable accordingly. The solid line represents the generation and the dotted line represents the consumption. The generation and consumption of coal has declined over time. This indicates that the US is trying to reduce the usage of coal over the past two decades due to environmental considerations. On the contrary, the gas and renewable categories are on the up-trend. Oil production has been rising while having a steady consumption. Nuclear source generation and consumption change is steady over the years and the generated energy is fully consumed. Similar observations can be found for renewable energy sources. 
					<br><br>
					Users may interact with the “Net US BBTU by year” by dragging horizontally to filter specific years to details of energy consumption and generation for each energy source.

					<div class="mission1">This visualization provides a comprehensive comparison of renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption and generation in the United States from 2001 to 2021. It's an interactive dashboard that enables users to switch between renewable and nonrenewable energy data, as well as explore it at the state or national level.
					<br><br>
					When focusing on renewable energy, a glance at the graphs reveals that energy consumption and generation closely align, indicating that what is generated is largely consumed. Conversely, when examining the nonrenewable energy graphs, a significant gap exists between consumption and generation. Notably, nonrenewable energy consumption has dropped by over 85% during the 2001-2021 period, while generation has increased by 30%. The central line chart illustrates that consumption and generation trends are gradually converging.
					<br><br>
					Specifically examining California, both renewable energy generation and consumption are on the rise, with consumption growing slightly faster. The statewide totals displayed at the bottom of the dashboard highlight that California boasts the highest renewable energy consumption and the second-highest renewable energy generation in the nation, surpassed only by Washington. In the nonrenewable energy sector, both consumption and generation are declining in California, with consumption being approximately three times higher than generation.
					<br><br>
					In contrast, Texas presents a different narrative for nonrenewable energy. Surprisingly, nonrenewable energy generation in Texas has surged by 140%, while consumption has decreased by roughly 90%. The bottom graph illustrates that Texas significantly outpaces other states in nonrenewable energy consumption and generation.

					<div class="sectiontitle">Energy Expenditure and Costs</div>
					<div class="mission1">US States spend over 13 billion dollars annually for energy. The energy spending factor is directly related to the energy consumption. Besides, the energy cost is also another factor that leads to high energy bills for each state. Therefore, it is also helpful to review how each state spends on energy and the individual energy cost. Energy cost varies based on many factors - generated energy able to meet the demands or purchase energy from other states. The natural resources availability in each state. For example, natural resources like coal, oil etc. To investigate this aspect, we provide the following visualization to review the cost and expenditure of each state per year. Users may select the energy view of either cost or expenditure from the dropdown at the bottom of the chart. Both top and bottom charts will update accordingly. The top chart represents the average for the overall US per year and the bottom one shows the detailed cost or expenditure per state in the selected year from the first chart.
					<br><br>
					By reviewing the expenditure view, the highest expenditure states are California and Texas that have high energy consumption from technological companies and industrial sectors respectively. As the state of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA">California</a> has elongated shape stretches more than 1000 miles long and 500 miles wide, transportation covers the largest share of the state's energy expenditure. From the energy price, State <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=HI">Hawaii</a> (HI) is the highest cost at $30.08 per MBTu since 2008. The reason is because over 80 percent of all the energy used in Hawaii for electricity, surface and air transportation comes from imported fossil fuels. The amount of energy consumption is almost seven times more than it produces. Main energy generation source is petroleum and fossil fuel based. In 2022,  solar power, one of the renewable energy sources, provided about 17% of Hawaii's total electricity from small-scale, customer-sited solar power generation. This might alleviate high energy costs.
