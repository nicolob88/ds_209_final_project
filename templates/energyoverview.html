					<div class="mission1">As energy demands become bigger every year, it is imperative to understand how much energy is being generated, how much is consumed and what is its cost. At the same time, the footprint that non-renewable energies are leaving on the planet is becoming more palpable every year, it has become of utmost importance to understand which are the sources we use to generate energy and how we can shift towards a more sustainable path. Using data from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php#StatisticsIndicators">EIA</a>, the dashboard below shows a summary of the energy generation for the US, by state and year, for the past two decades. The areas give a sense of the contribution each source had to the total generated energy, you can choose from the Metric filter to see those as percent share (normalized). The bubbles then give you additional details of the share each energy source had over the total energy generated. Last, the bars display how much each generated in total. The graph is interactive, you can select, by clicking, a year on the area chart, a state on the bar chart and/or source on the bubble chart to filter the graphs and access the details you want to see. To unselect, you can click on an empty space of the chart.</div>

					<div class="mission1">US energy generation has been growing steadily, except for a small dip during the pandemic of COVID-19, for the past 2 decades. The generation is measured in billions of British thermal units (bBTU) which grew roughly by 67% between 2001 and 2021. At the same time, major structural changes happened on the sources that account for the total energy generated. Coal dropped from being the main energy source in 2001 with 37% of the total to the third place with only 12% in 2021. On the other hand, Natural Gas has added over 25M bBTUs of energy generated during the same period, becoming the main source of energy with over 44% of the total energy in 2021. Renewable sources of energy have also increased slowly and steadily, adding 5 percent points of the total energy share, from 8% to 13% during the 2001-2021 period.<br>
					<br>
					From all the States, TX has been consistently the one that generated the most energy throughout the last 2 decades and is increasing the gap with other states. Nonetheless, 90% of the energy TX generated in 2021 came from Oil and Gas, and only 5% came from renewable sources. In that same year, the States that generated the most renewable energy were WA and CA.

					<div class="sectiontitle">Energy Consumption and Energy Generation</div>
					<div class="mission1">
					In exploring the intricate landscape of energy generation and consumption trends, delving into the nuanced distribution from various energy source types—such as oil, gas, nuclear, and renewable—proves to be immensely informative. This detailed examination allows users to discern the trends of each energy source type over the years, unraveling the intricate shifts in energy source dependencies.
					<br><br>
					The comprehensive visualization presented here spans two decades, offering a multifaceted perspective on both energy generation and consumption. Beginning with the "Net US BBTU by year" chart in the top left corner, this visual representation employs the unit of BBTU (Billion BTU, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit">British thermal unit</a>) to measure heat as the form of energy. Calculated by contrasting the differences between energy generation and consumption, this chart vividly illustrates that, for the majority of the years, US states experienced an energy deficit. The persistent pink bars indicate instances where consumption exceeded generation, a scenario that endured until 2019 when a subtle energy surplus, denoted by the emergence of blue bars, finally manifested.
					<br><br>
					Moving to the lower left chart, named "US energy generation/consumption," an area chart unfolds the intricate details of generation and consumption in each year. Noteworthy is the observation that energy consumption consistently hovers around 90 to 100 trillion BTU, while energy generation has witnessed a steady ascent from 70 to approximately 95 to 100 trillion BTU since 2001.
					<br><br>
					TThe trio of smaller charts on the right delves into the specifics of generation and consumption for individual energy sources: Coal, Oil, Gas, Nuclear, and Renewable. Distinct patterns emerge as the solid lines depict generation, and dotted lines outline consumption. Coal, reflecting a declining trend, indicates a concerted effort in the US to curtail its usage over the past two decades, driven by environmental considerations. In contrast, both gas and renewable categories exhibit upward trajectories. Oil production sees a consistent rise, maintaining a steady consumption pattern. The generation and consumption dynamics of nuclear sources remain stable over the years, with the energy generated being fully consumed—an observation echoed in renewable energy sources. 
					<br><br>
					Interactivity becomes a key feature for users engaging with the "Net US BBTU by year." By horizontally dragging to filter specific years, users gain detailed insights into energy consumption and generation for each energy source, fostering a dynamic and immersive exploration of the evolving energy landscape.

					<div class="mission1">When focusing on renewable energy, a glance at the graphs reveals that energy consumption and generation closely align, indicating that what is generated is largely consumed. Conversely, when examining the nonrenewable energy graphs, a significant gap exists between consumption and generation. Notably, nonrenewable energy consumption has dropped by over 85% during the 2001-2021 period, while generation has increased by 30%. The central line chart illustrates that consumption and generation trends are gradually converging.
					<br><br>
					Specifically examining California, both renewable energy generation and consumption are on the rise, with consumption growing slightly faster. The statewide totals displayed at the bottom of the dashboard highlight that California boasts the highest renewable energy consumption and the second-highest renewable energy generation in the nation, surpassed only by Washington. In the nonrenewable energy sector, both consumption and generation are declining in California, with consumption being approximately three times higher than generation.
					<br><br>
					In contrast, Texas presents a different narrative for nonrenewable energy. Surprisingly, nonrenewable energy generation in Texas has surged by 140%, while consumption has decreased by roughly 90%. The bottom graph illustrates that Texas significantly outpaces other states in nonrenewable energy consumption and generation.

					<div class="sectiontitle">Energy Expenditure and Costs</div>
					<div class="mission1">Diving into the fiscal landscape of US states, where an annual expenditure exceeding 13 billion dollars is earmarked for energy, unveils a direct correlation between energy spending and consumption. This spending dynamic, coupled with the associated energy costs, significantly contributes to the formulation of high energy bills for each state. To gain a nuanced understanding of these financial intricacies, it becomes imperative to scrutinize how each state allocates its budget to energy and the ensuing individual energy costs.
					<br><br>
					The visualization offered herein facilitates this exploration, shedding light on the cost and expenditure of each state per year. Users can dynamically toggle between views of either cost or expenditure by utilizing the dropdown menu at the chart's bottom. The top chart provides an overview of the average for the entire US per year, while the bottom chart delves into the granular details of cost or expenditure per state for the selected year from the first chart.

						</iframe>
					</div>
					<div class="mission1">
					A closer examination of the expenditure view reveals that California and Texas consistently emerge as the highest expenditure states, driven by the energy-intensive operations of technological companies and industrial sectors, respectively. The elongated shape of <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CA">California</a>, spanning over 1000 miles long and 500 miles wide, accentuates transportation as the leading contributor to the state's energy expenditure.

					In terms of energy prices, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=HI">Hawaii</a> (HI) stands out as the highest-cost state since 2008, with a price tag of $30.08 per MBTu. This elevated cost is attributed to over 80 percent of the state's energy consumption for electricity, surface, and air transportation being sourced from imported fossil fuels. Notably, Hawaii's energy consumption dwarfs its production, with a reliance on petroleum and fossil fuel-based generation. The year 2022 witnessed a positive shift with solar power, a renewable energy source, contributing about 17% of Hawaii's total electricity—an encouraging step towards mitigating high energy costs.
